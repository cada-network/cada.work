      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        CADA is a social network and collaborative working group for STEM
        students alongside their studies. It allows them to get involved in
        interesting, impactful projects, build networks of friends and
        collaborators, and develop their employment options with progressive
        organisations.

      <p>
        We bring STEM and data science students and academics together at local
        and national scales, online and in-person.
      </p>

        <p>
          Some outputs bolster specific, existing initiatives for good, others
          are useful resources to augment many different actors (e.g. climate
          research, poverty-related data creation). All research outputs and
          prototypes are made publicly available and open-source.
        </p>

      <p>
        The network encourages creativity in scientific practice and thought.
        It's a community where individuals develop their skills together, as
        well as their political understanding.
      </p>
      <div class="move-right">
        <h1 class="acronym-title"> <span class="big-letter">A</span>ction </h1>
        <p>
          We build prototypes and tools for progressive causes. Research outputs
          from the network are put out online for free via a dedicated virtual
          resource (including code, data sources and so on). Network members
          have access to Autonomy's communications expertise and networks - in
          order to optimise impact.
